## Programming Foundations: Design Patterns

Fundamentals properties of Obeject-Oriented Design
* Inherintece
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation

Design Patterns provide paths to solutions for some of the most common object-oriented design conundrums.

### Benefits
* Not reivent the wheel
* Building resilient code
* Preparing for future additions

> **Encapsulate your varies**  
> Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
> * if some aspect of your code is changing , that's a sign you should pull it out and separete it
> * By separeting out the parts of your code that change, you can extend or alter them without affecting the rest of your code
> * This principle is fundamental to almost every design pattern
